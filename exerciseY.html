    <p>
      Welcome to the Snake Game! The objective of the game is to control the snake using the arrow keys
      and collect as much food as possible. Every time the snake eats the food, it grows longer, and
      your score increases. Be careful not to run into the walls or the snake's own body, or the game
      will end!
    </p>
    <p>How to Play:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the <strong>Arrow Keys</strong> to control the snake's direction.</li>
      <li>Eat the red squares (food) to grow and increase your score.</li>
      <li>Avoid crashing into the walls or yourself.</li>
    </ul>
